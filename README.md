# Color-detection-Tkinter
**Color detection🎨in photos using Tkinter GUI and OpenCV - python**
# Methodology 
The app takes a photo as an input from the pc💻then it change it to from bgr to hsv so it can search in a specific range of color using upper⬆️and lower⬇️bounds for each color and then it returns a mask with the detected color on the original image so it is displayed as it was entered with only the color chosen is displayed on the screen 

# Note 🗒 
**If you want a video🎥option you can find it on my github😺in the repo called Color-detection-webcam**
